            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Senior at UMass Lowell studying computer science, my expected graduation date is May 2024.
                I have worked on a variety of languages throughout school and in my internships. I know C++, Java, Python, C#, 
                PHP, and SQLite. As a non-traditional student I bring a unique experience to a company and I can be a valuable assett to any company.
                In my free time I enjoy playing with my dog and learning the piano.
